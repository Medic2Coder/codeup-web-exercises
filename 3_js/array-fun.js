    //Notes:
    //Always remember:
    //index starts at 0
    //length starts at 1

    // to make it repeatable in a loop, start with i that is 0
// the length will be four, but four does not exist because the index is three.

    //undefined in javascript but in other languages will yell out you saying out of range
