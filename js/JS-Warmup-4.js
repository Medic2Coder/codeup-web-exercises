// JS Object Warmup, pt 4:
// We are going to create a method which
let name = window.prompt("Enter all your names to your heart's content: ");
alert("Your name is " + name);
// allows a user to input their desired amount of names names

// use prompt, alert, confirm inside of a while loop

//     assign each name to an array
let name = [];
// once the user decides they are done giving names, end the loop and return the string array

// then assigning that returned array by invoking your new function on the Person.names property value!


//     Things to consider:
//     Should this be a standalone function or should it be a method on the Person object?

//prompt, alert, confirm then should use an html file
